		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form.
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Zhengyang Wang


B: Fan Jin



(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings                    12         12

total (including meetings)  36         32


(3) Describe
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
  Zhengyang:
    Implement the shared memory kernel with optimization tricks;
    Run experiments on 20 data points with TW=32.
    Write and explain pseudocode in report.
  Fan:
    Review pull requests on GitHub;
    Tune block sizes among 4x4, 8x4, 8x8, 16x8, 16x16, 32x16;
    Run experiments on 20 data points with TW=16;
    Visualize experiment results and plot the roofline model in report.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
    Yes, we did.
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
